# Caesar-Cypher-Encryption-and-Decryption
A Python implementation of the Caesar Cipher for encrypting and decrypting text with user-defined shift values ‚Äî a simple yet powerful introduction to cryptography.
# üîê Caesar Cipher Tool (Text + Image)

This project is a **Python GUI application** that demonstrates encryption and decryption of **both text and images** using the classical **Caesar Cipher algorithm**.  

## ‚ú® Features
- Encrypt & decrypt **text messages** with a custom shift key.  
- Encrypt & decrypt **images** by modifying pixel values.  
- Simple and interactive **Tkinter-based GUI**.  
- Option to **upload, view, and save images** after processing.  

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- **Python 3**  
- **Tkinter** for GUI  
- **Pillow (PIL)** for image processing  

## üöÄ How to Run
```bash
pip install pillow
python "Encryption and Decryption.py"
